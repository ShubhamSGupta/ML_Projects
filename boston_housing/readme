A regression predictive modeling project end-to-end.
includes:
1) evaluating algorithms using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric
2) data transforms to improve model performance
         Standardization
         Pipelines
3) algorithm tuning to improve model performance.
4) ensemble methods and tuning of ensemble methods to improve model performance:
         Boosting Methods: AdaBoost (AB) and Gradient Boosting (GBM).
         Bagging Methods: Random Forests (RF) and Extra Trees (ET).
